# Core Graphics Introduction

This is my implementation of the [Core Graphics Tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/8003281-core-graphics-tutorial-getting-started) by Andrew Kharchyshyn at raywenderlich.com

This project is built using Swift, UIKit, Core Graphics, and Core Animation. 

## My Changes

I decided to build the project programmatically instead of using Storyboards. 

## What I learned 

Core Graphics Basics, including:

Drawing arcs, lines, ovals, and other shapes with UIBezierPath

Drawing patterns to fill an area

Converting a drawing to a UIImage
